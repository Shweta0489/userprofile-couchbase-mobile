== Introduction
Couchbase Lite 2.0 brings powerful querying and Full-Text-Search(FTS) capabilties to the edge. The new query interface is based on link:https://www.couchbase.com/products/n1ql[N1QL], Couchbaseâ€™s declarative query language that extends link:https://www.sqlite.org/index.html[SQL] for JSON. If you are familiar with SQL, you will feel right at home with the semantics of the new API.  The query API is designed using the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface[Fluent API Design Pattern], and it uses method cascading to read to like a Domain Specific Language (DSL). This makes the interface very intuitive and easy to understand.

Couchbase Mobile supports flexible link:https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/mobile/2.0/userprofile_basic.html[deployment models]. 

This tutorial will walkthrough a simple swift app that will 
* Include an instance of Couchbase Lite 2.0 as a _Prebuilt_ Database that can be bundled with your app
* Introduce you to the basics of the QueryBuilder interface

====
You can learn more about Couchbase Mobile https://developer.couchbase.com/mobile[here]
====

== Prerequisites
This tutorial assumes familiarity with building swift apps with Xcode.

* If you are unfamiliar with the basics of Couchbase Lite, it is recommended that you walk through the link:https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/mobile/2.0/userprofile_basic.html[tutorial] on using Couchbase Lite 2.0 as a standalone database

* iOS (Xcode 9.3+) 
  Download latest version from the link:https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12[Mac App Store]
                        
* git (Optional)
This is required if you would prefer to pull the source code from GitHub repo.
** Create a link:https://github.com[free github account] if you don't already have one
** git can be downloaded from link:https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git[git-scm.org]

== App Overview
We will be working with a very simple "User Profile" app. If you had walked through the link:https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/mobile/2.0/userprofile_basic.html[Fundamentals tutorial], you would quickly realize that this version extends the funcationality introduced in the version introduced in that tutorial.

This app does the following 

* Allows users to log in and create or update his/her user profile information. You could do that in the link:https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/mobile/2.0/userprofile_basic.html[Fundamentals tutorial]
* In addition, users can select a "university" from a list of possible options

The list of matching univerisities is queried (using the new Query API) from a local pre-built "University" Couchbase Lite Database that is bundled in the app. The user profile information is persisted as a Document in the local Couchbase Lite Database. So subsquently, when the user logs out and logs back in again, the profile information is loaded from the Database.

== Installation

=== Fetching App Source Code

==== Option 1 : Git Clone

- Clone the *_query_* branch of the `User Profile Demo` project from GitHub. Type the following command in your terminal
+
[source,bash] 
----
  git clone -b query https://github.com/couchbaselabs/userprofile-couchbase-mobile.git
----

==== Option 2 : Download .zip

- Download the  `User Profile Demo` project from link:https://github.com/couchbaselabs/userprofile-couchbase-mobile/archive/query.zip[here]

=== Installing Couchbase Lite Framework

- Next, we will download the Couchbase Lite 2.0 framework. The Couchbase Lite iOS framework is link:https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/mobile/2.0/couchbase-lite/swift.html[distributed] via Cocoapods, Carthage or you can download the pre-built framework. In our example, we will be downloading the pre-built version of the framework. For this, do the following
+
[source,bash] 
----
  cd /path/to/UserProfileDemo/content/modules/userprofile/examples

  sh install_9.sh
----

Now, let's verify the installation

=== Try it Out
* Open the `UserProfileDemo.xcodeproj`. The project would be located at `/path/to/UserProfileDemo/content/modules/userprofile/examples`
+
[source,bash]
----
open UserProfileDemo.xcodeproj
----
+
* Build and run the project using the _simulator_ in Xcode. While you can run the app on a real device, we recommend the Simulator so you can see the debug logs in the output console.
* Verify that you see the login screen
+

== Data Model
Couchbase Lite is a JSON Document Store. A Document is a logical collection of named fields and values.The values are any valid JSON types. In addition to the standard JSON types, Couchbase Lite supports some special types like `Date` and `Blob`.
While it is not required or enforced, it is a recommended practice to include a _"type"_ property that can serve as a namespace for related. 

=== The "User Profile" Document
The app deals with a single Document with a _"type"_ property of _"user"_.  The document ID is of the form _"user::<email>"_.
An example of a document would be 

```json
{
    "type":"user",
    "name":"Jane Doe",
    "email":"jame.doe@earth.org",
    "address":"101 Main Street",
    "image":CBLBlob (image/jpg),
    "university":"Rensselaer Polytechnic"
}
```

=== UserRecord 

The _"user"_ Document is encoded to a native struct named _UserRecord_.

[source,swift]
----
include::{examplesdir}/UserProfileDemo/model/UserRecord.swift[tags=userrecord]
----

== The "University" Document
The app comes bundled with a collection of Documents of type _"university"_. Each Document represents a university.


```json
{
    "type":"university","web_pages": [
      "http://www.rpi.edu/"
    ],
    "name": "Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute",
    "alpha_two_code": "US",
    "state-province": null,
    "domains": [
      "rpi.edu"
    ],
    "country": "United States"
}
```

=== UniversityRecord 

The _"university"_ Document is encoded to a native struct named _UniversityRecord_.

[source,swift]
----
include::{examplesdir}/UserProfileDemo/model/UserRecord.swift[tags=universityrecord]
----

== Using a Prebuilt Database
There are several reasons why you may want to bundle your app with a prebuilt database. This would be suited for data that does not change or change that often, so you can avoid the bandwidth and latency involved in fetching/syncing this data from a remote server. This also improves the overall user experience by reducing the start-up time.

=== Location of the cblite file
The pre-built database will be in the form of a `cblite` file. It should be copied into you app project bundle
* In the `UserProfileDemo.xcodeproj` project explorer, locate the `universities.cblite2` file
+
image::cblite_location.png[Prebuilt Database Location]


=== Loading the Prebuilt Database
* Open the *DatabaseManager.swift* file and locate the `openPrebuiltDatabase()` function. The prebuilt database is common to all users of the app (on the device). So it will be loaded once and shared by all users on the device.
+
[source,swift]
----
include::{examplesdir}/UserProfileDemo/model/DatabaseManager.swift[tags=openPrebuiltDatabase]
----

* First, we create an instance of `DatabaseConfiguration` object and specify the path where the database would be located
+
[source,swift]
----
include::{examplesdir}/UserProfileDemo/model/DatabaseManager.swift[tags=dbconfig]
----

* Then we determine if the database "universities" already exists at the specified location. It would not be present if this is the first time we are using the app, in which case, we locate the _"universities.cblite"_ resource in the App's main bundle and we copy it over to the Database folder.  
If the database is already present at the specified Database location, we simply open the database.
+ 
[source,swift]
----
include::{examplesdir}/UserProfileDemo/model/DatabaseManager.swift[tags=prebuiltdbopen]
----

=== Closing the Database
When a user logs out, we close the Prebuilt Database along with other user-specific databases

* Open the *DatabaseManager.swift* file and locate the `closePrebuiltDatabase()` function. 
+
[source,swift]
----
include::{examplesdir}/UserProfileDemo/model/DatabaseManager.swift[tags=closePrebuiltDatabase]
----

* Closing the database is pretty straightforward
+
[source,swift]
----
include::{examplesdir}/UserProfileDemo/model/DatabaseManager.swift[tags=dbclose]
----

=== Try It Out
* The app should be running in the simulator
* Log into the app with any email Id and password. Let's use the values _"demo@example.com"_ and _"password"_ for user Id and password fields respectively. If this is the first time that _any_ user is signing in to the app, the pre-built database will be loaded from the App Bundle. In addition, new user-specific Database will be created / opened.
* Confirm that the console log output has a message similar to the one below. In my example, I am logging in with a user email Id of _"demo@example.com"_.
+
[source,bash]
----
Will open Prebuilt DB  at path /Users/priya.rajagopal/Library/Developer/CoreSimulator/Devices/E4E62394-9940-4AF8-92FC-41E3C794B216/data/Containers/Data/Application/A9425551-7F52-461D-B4F5-CC04315154D6/Library/Application Support

---- 
* The above log message indicate the location of the Prebuilt database as well as the Database for the user. This would be within the _Application Support_ folder.
* Open the folder in your Finder app and verify that a Database with name _"univerities"_ exists along with a user specific Database with name _"userprofile"_

== Exploring the Query API
The Query API in Couchbase Lite 2.0 is extensive. In our app, we will be using the `QueryBuilder` API to make a simple _pattern matching_ query using the `like` Query Expression. 

=== Fetching University Document
Once the user logs in, the user is taken to the "Your Profile" screen. When the user taps on the "University" cell, a search screen is displayed where the user can enter the search criteria (name and optionally, the location) for the university. When the search criteria is entered, the local _"universities"_ Database is queried for <<The "University" Document>> documents that match the specified search criteria. 

* Open the *UniversityPresenter.swift* file and locate the `fetchUniversityRecords()` function.
+
[source,swift]
----
include::{examplesdir}/UserProfileDemo/presenter/UniversityPresenter.swift[tags=fetchUniversityRecords]
----

* We build the Query using the `QueryBuilder` API that will look for Documents that match the specified criteria.
+
[source,swift]
----
include::{examplesdir}/UserProfileDemo/presenter/UniversityPresenter.swift[tags=buildquery]
----
<1> Build a `QueryExpression` that uses the `like` operator to look for the specified _"name"_ string in the _"name"_ property. Notice couple of things here - (a) The use of *wildcard "%" operator* to denote that we are looking for the presence of the string anywhere in the _"name"_ property and (b) The use of `Function.lowercase()` to convert the search string into lowercase equivalent. Since `like` operator does _case-senstive matching_, we convert the search string and the property value to lowercase equivalents and compare the two.
<2> If the location criteria was specified in the search, then Build a `QueryExpression` that uses the `like` operator to look for the specified _"location"_ string in the _"location"_ property.
<3> The `SelectResult.all()` specifiees that we are interested in all properties in Documents that match the specified criteria
<4> The `DataSource.database(db)` specified the Data Source
<5> We include the `where` clause that is the logical ANDing of the QueryExpression in <1> and <2>


* We run the Query by calling the `execute()` method on the Query that was constructed in the previous step
+
[source,swift]
----
include::{examplesdir}/UserProfileDemo/presenter/UniversityPresenter.swift[tags=runquery]
----
<1> Create an instance of <<UniversityRecord>> type
<1> Use specific type getters to fetch property values. These <<UniversityRecord>> instance is populated with these property values.
<2> Getters also available for `array` types. This returns a Couchbase Lite `ArrayObject` type. So you would have to use `toArray()` to convert the Couchbase Lite native array equivalent.


=== Creating / Updating a Document
A <<The "User Profile" Document>> is created for the user when the user taps the "Done" button on the "Profile Screen". 
The function below applies whether you are creating a document or updating an existing version

* Open the *UserPresenter.swift* file and locate the `setRecordForCurrentUser()` method.
+ 
[source,swift]
----
include::{examplesdir}/UserProfileDemo/presenter/UserPresenter.swift[tags=setRecordForCurrentUser]
----


* We create a *mutable* instance of the Document. By default, all APIs in Couchbase Lite deal with immutable objects, thereby making them *thread-safe* by design. In order to mutate an object,  you must explicitly get a mutable copy of the object.
Use appropriate type-setters to set the various properties of the Document 
+
[source,swift]
----
include::{examplesdir}/UserProfileDemo/presenter/UserPresenter.swift[tags=docset]
----
<1> Specifically, note the support of the `setBlob` type to fetch the value of a property of type `Blob`.

* Save the document
+
[source,swift]
----
include::{examplesdir}/UserProfileDemo/presenter/UserPresenter.swift[tags=docsave]
----


=== Deleting a Document
We don't delete a Document in this sample app. However, deletion of a document is pretty straightforward and this is how you would do it.

[source,swift]
----
if let doc = db.document(withID: idOfDocToRemove) {
	try db.deleteDocument(doc)
}
----

=== Try It Out
* You should have followed the steps discussed in the "Try It Out" section under <<Create / Open a Database>>
* Enter a "name" for the user in the Text Entry box and Tap "Done"
* Confirm that you see an alert message "Succesfully Updated Profile". The first time, you update the profile screen, the Document will be created. 
+
image::doc_create.png[User Profile Document Creation]
+
* Now tap on the "Tap!" button and select an image from the Photo Album. Tap "Done".
+
image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/couchbaselabs/userprofile-couchbase-mobile/standalone/content/modules/userprofile/assets/images/image_selection.gif[Image Selection]
+
* Confirm that you see an alert message "Succesfully Updated Profile". The Document will be updated this time.
* Tap "Log Off" and log out of the app
* Log back into the app with the same user email Id and password that you used earlier. In my example, I used _"demo@example.com"_ and _"password"_. So I will log in with those credentials again.
* Confirm that you see the profile screen  with the _name_ and _image_ values that you set earlier. 
+
