== Introduction
Couchbase Sync Gateway is a key component of the Couchbase Mobile stack. It is an Internet-facing synchronization mechanism that securely syncs data across devices as well as between devices and the cloud.
It provides

* Data Synchronization across devices and the cloud
* Authorization & Access Control
* Data Validation


This tutorial will walk through a simple swift app that will demonstrate

* how to use the Sync Gateway (in walrus mode) to sync content between multiple Couchbase Lite enabled clients. This will cover the basics of the link:https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/mobile/2.0/guides/sync-gateway/config-properties/index.html[Sync Gateway Configuration] and `Sync Function API`
* how to configure your Couchbase Lite clients for replication
* how to set up Live Queries within your Couchbase Lite clients so they are asyncronously notified of changes

====
You can learn more about the Sync Gateway https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/mobile/2.0/guides/sync-gateway/index.html[here]
====

== Prerequisites
This tutorial assumes familiarity with building swift apps with Xcode and with Couchbase Lite.

* If you are unfamiliar with the basics of Couchbase Lite, it is recommended that you walk through the following tutorials
+
** link:https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/mobile/2.0/userprofile_basic.html[Fundamentals] of using Couchbase Lite 2.0 as a standalone database
** link:https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/mobile/2.0/userprofile_basic.html[Query Basics] with a prebuilt version of Couchbase Lite database

* iOS (Xcode 9.3+) 
  Download latest version from the link:https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12[Mac App Store]
                        
* git (Optional)
This is required if you would prefer to pull the source code from GitHub repo.
** Create a link:https://github.com[free github account] if you don't already have one
** git can be downloaded from link:https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git[git-scm.org]

== System Overview
We will be working with a simple "User Profile" app. The version of the app extends the version introduced in the link:https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/mobile/2.0/userprofile_basic.html[Query tutorial].

The app does the following 

* Allows users to log in and create or update his/her user profile information. The user profile view is _automatically updated_ everytime the profile information changes in the underlying database
* The user profile information is synced with a remote Sync Gateway which then syncs it to other apps (subject to access control and routing confdistions specified in the `sync function`)

== App Installation

=== Fetching App Source Code

==== Option 1 : Git Clone

- Clone the *_sync_* branch of the `User Profile Demo` project from GitHub. Type the following command in your terminal
+
[source,bash] 
----
  git clone -b sync https://github.com/couchbaselabs/userprofile-couchbase-mobile.git
----

==== Option 2 : Download .zip

- Download the  `User Profile Demo` project from link:https://github.com/couchbaselabs/userprofile-couchbase-mobile/archive/sync.zip[here]

=== Installing Couchbase Lite Framework

- Next, we will download the Couchbase Lite 2.0 framework. The Couchbase Lite iOS framework is link:https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/mobile/2.0/couchbase-lite/swift.html[distributed] via Cocoapods, Carthage or you can download the pre-built framework. In our example, we will be downloading the pre-built version of the framework. For this, do the following
+
[source,bash] 
----
  cd /path/to/UserProfileDemo/content/modules/userprofile/examples

  sh install_9.sh
----

Now, let's verify the installation

=== Try it Out
* Open the `UserProfileDemo.xcodeproj`. The project would be located at `/path/to/UserProfileDemo/content/modules/userprofile/examples`
+
[source,bash]
----
open UserProfileDemo.xcodeproj
----
+
* Build and run the project using the *two simulators* in Xcode
* Verify that you see the login screen on both the simulators
+

== Sync Gateway 2.0 Installation
There are several link:https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/mobile/2.0/installation/sync-gateway/index.html[deployment] options for the Sync Gateway. In our tutorial, we will be installing the Sync Gateway installer on the same _localhost_ as the mobile app

=== Download the Installer
* Download the Sync Gateway 2.0.0 installer from link:https://www.couchbase.com/downloads#couchbase-mobile[Downloads] page. Be sure to select the *"Mobile"* tab.

* Launch the Sync Gateway with the *sync-gateway-config-userprofile-walrus.json* config file that is bundled with the User Profile mobile App that you installed as per instructions in <<Fetching App Source Code>> section. The `sync-gateway-config-userprofile-walrus.json` will be located in the `/path/to/UserProfileDemo/content/modules/userprofile/examples/` folder 
+
[source,bash]
----
cd  /path/to/sync-gateway-installation/couchbase-sync-gateway/bin

./sync_gateway /path/to/UserProfileDemo/content/modules/userprofile/examples/sync-gateway-config-userprofile-walrus.json
----
+
* You should see a bunch of logs output to the console, similar to one below. For brevity, some of the log messages have been trimmed from output below
+
[source,bash]
----
~/couchbase-sync-gateway/bin | => ./sync_gateway ~/projects/ios/UserProfileDemo/content/modules/userprofile/examples/sync-gateway-config-userprofile-walrus.json

Now, let's verify the installation

=== Try it Out
* Open a browser and enter `http://localhost:4984` in the address bar
* You should see a message similar one below
+
[source,bash]
----
{"couchdb":"Welcome","vendor":{"name":"Couchbase Sync Gateway","version":"2.0"},"version":"Couchbase Sync Gateway/2.0.0(832;2d8a6c0)"}
----


== Data Model
If have followed along the tutorial on link:[Query Basics], you can skip this section and proceed to the <<Sync Gateway Configuration>>. section We have not made any changes to the Data model for this tutorial.
Couchbase Lite is a JSON Document Store. A Document is a logical collection of named fields and values.The values are any valid JSON types. In addition to the standard JSON types, Couchbase Lite supports some special types like `Date` and `Blob`.
While it is not required or enforced, it is a recommended practice to include a _"type"_ property that can serve as a namespace for related. 

=== The "User Profile" Document
The app deals with a single Document with a _"type"_ property of _"user"_.  The document ID is of the form _"user::<email>"_.
An example of a document would be 

```json
{
    "type":"user",
    "name":"Jane Doe",
    "email":"jame.doe@earth.org",
    "address":"101 Main Street",
    "image":CBLBlob (image/jpg),
    "university":"Rensselaer Polytechnic"
}
```

=== UserRecord 

The _"user"_ Document is encoded to a native struct named _UserRecord_.

[source,swift]
----
include::{examplesdir}/UserProfileDemo/model/UserRecord.swift[tags=userrecord]
----

== The "University" Document
The app comes bundled with a collection of Documents of type _"university"_. Each Document represents a university.


```json
{
    "type":"university","web_pages": [
      "http://www.rpi.edu/"
    ],
    "name": "Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute",
    "alpha_two_code": "US",
    "state-province": null,
    "domains": [
      "rpi.edu"
    ],
    "country": "United States"
}
```

=== UniversityRecord 

The _"university"_ Document is encoded to a native struct named _UniversityRecord_.

[source,swift]
----
include::{examplesdir}/UserProfileDemo/model/UserRecord.swift[tags=universityrecord]
----

== Sync Gateway Configuration 
The link:https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/mobile/2.0/guides/sync-gateway/config-properties/index.html[Sync Gateway Configuration] determines the run time behavior of the Sync Gateway and is typically specified in a JSON file. You can also use the link:https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/mobile/2.0/references/sync-gateway/admin-rest-api/index.html#/database/put__db___config[Sync Gateway Config REST Endpoint] to specify the configuration. In our application, we will be defining it in the `*sync-gateway-config-userprofile-walrus.json*` file.

* Open the `*sync-gateway-config-userprofile-walrus.json*` file using any text editor of your choice. The `sync-gateway-config-userprofile-walrus.json` is located in the app bundle at `/path/to/UserProfileDemo/content/modules/userprofile/examples`. 
+
Locate the following settings.
+
* The *users* setting. 
+
For simplicity, we have hardcoded the `user` to be _"demo@example.com"_ and the `password` of _"password"_. In a production app, you would typically configure the user on the Sync Gateway through the link:https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/mobile/2.0/references/sync-gateway/admin-rest-api/index.html#/user/post__db___user_[User Admin REST API] and not hardcode it this way.
+
This is specified using the `users` config setting
+
[source,json]
----
"userprofile": {
      "users": { "demo@example.com": { "password": "password"} },
      ....
}
----
+
NOTE: If you want to want to use a different user, then specify the credentials of that user to the config file and restart the Sync Gateway. 

* The *server* setting
We have specified this to be `*walrus*`. This is an _in-memory-only_ mode that is only recommended for development environments. We will be configuring Sync Gateway to operate in this mode. 
In a production deployment, the Sync Gatway should be backed up by a Couchbase Server.
+
This is specified using the `server` config setting
+
[source,json]
----
"userprofile": {
      "server": "walrus:",
      ....
}
----

====
You can learn more about the walrus mode in this link:https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/mobile/current/installation/sync-gateway/index.html#walrus-mode[guide].
====

== Sync Function
The Sync Function is a Javascript function that is specified as part of the <<Sync Gateway Configuration>>. The Sync Function handles data validation, authorization, access control and data routing. 

* Open the `*sync-gateway-config-userprofile-walrus.json*` file using any text editor of your choice. The `sync-gateway-config-userprofile-walrus.json` is located in the app bundle at `/path/to/UserProfileDemo/content/modules/userprofile/examples`. 
** Locate the `sync` setting and follow along with the rest of the sections below

=== Authorization
We use the link:https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/mobile/2.0/guides/sync-gateway/sync-function-api-guide/index.html#requireuserusername[`requireUser()`] API to verify that the `email` property specified in the Document matches the Id of the user making the request. The Id of the user making the request is specified in the `Authorization` header. We will be using _Basic Authentication_ in our application. 
[source,javascript]
----
function sync(doc, oldDoc) {
   ....
   /* Authorization */

  // Verify the user making the request is the same as the one in doc's email
  requireUser(doc.email);
  .....
}
----

=== Data Validation
In this case, we are doing some basic validation of the contents of the Document
[source,javascript]
----
function sync(doc, oldDoc) {
   ... 
   /* Data Validation */

   if (!isDelete()) {
      // Validate the presence of email fields
      validateNotEmpty("email", doc.email); // <1>

      // Check if document is being created / added for first time
      // We allow any user to create the document
      if (isCreate()) {

        // Validate that the document Id _id is prefixed by owner.
        var expectedDocId = "user" + "::" + doc.email;

        if (expectedDocId != doc._id) { // <2>
            throw({forbidden: "user doc Id must be of form user:email"});
        }
      
      } else {       
         // Validate that the email hasn't changed.
        validateReadOnly("email", doc.email, oldDoc.email); // <3>
      }

    }


  // Verify that specified property exists
  function validateNotEmpty(key, value) {
    if (!value) {
      throw({forbidden: key + " is not provided."});
    }
  }

  // Verify that specified property value has not changed during update
  function validateReadOnly(name, value, oldValue) {
    if (value != oldValue) {
      throw({forbidden: name + " is read-only."});
    }
  }
----

<1> Verify that the `email` property is not null
<2> If this a new document, then verify that the `Id` of the Document is of the required format (i.e. _"user::<email>"_)
<3> If this is a document update, then verify that the `email` property value has not changed 


====
You can learn more about the Sync Function in this link:https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/mobile/2.0/guides/sync-gateway/sync-function-api-guide/index.htm[guide]
====


=== Data Routing
link:https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/mobile/2.0/guides/sync-gateway/channels/index.html#introduction-to-channels[`channels`] are a mechanism to "tag" documents and is typically used to seggregate documents based on the contents of the document. Combined with link:https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/mobile/2.0/guides/sync-gateway/sync-function-api-guide/index.html#access-username-channelname[access API] and link:[`requireAccess API`], it can be used to enforce <<Access Control>>. As we shall see in a later section, clients can use channels to pull only a subset of documents.

[source,javascript]
----
  /* Routing */
  // Subsequent updates to document must be authorized
  var email = getEmail();

  // Add doc to the user's channel.
  channel("channel." + email); // <1>

  // get email Id property
  function getEmail() {
    return (isDelete() ? oldDoc.email : doc.email);
  }

----
<1> The channel comes into existance the first time a document is added to it. In our case, the channel name is generated from the `email` property specified in the document

=== Access Control
You can enforce access control to channels using the link:https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/mobile/2.0/guides/sync-gateway/sync-function-api-guide/index.html#access-username-channelname[access API]. This will enforce that only users with access to a specific channel will be able to retrieve documents in the channel.

[source,javascript]
----
  /* Access Control */
  // Give user read access to channel
   if (!isDelete()) {
    // Deletion of user document is essentially deletion of user
       access(email,"channel." + email)
   }

----

== Starting Replication

Two-way Replication between the app and the Sync Gateway is enabled when user logs into the app.

* Open the **DatabaseManager.swift** file and locate the `startPushAndPullReplicationForCurrentUser()` function.
+
[source,swift]
----
include::{examplesdir}/UserProfileDemo/model/DatabaseManager.swift[tags=startPushAndPullReplicationForCurrentUser]
----
+
* Next, we create an instance of the `ReplicatorConfig` instance that specifies the source and target database and you can optionally, override the default configuration settings.
+
[source,swift]
----
include::{examplesdir}/UserProfileDemo/model/DatabaseManager.swift[tags=replicationconfig]
----
+
<1> Initialize with `source` as the local Couchbase Lite database and the `remote` target as the Sync Gateway
<2> Replication `type` of `pushAndPull` indicates that we require two-way sync. A value of `.pull` specifies that we only pull data from the Sync Gateway. A value of `.push` specifies that we only push data.
<3> The `continuous` mode is specified to be _true_ which means that changes are synced in real-time. A value of _false_  which implies that data is only pulled from the Sync Gateway. 
<4> This is where you specify the authentication credentials of the user. In the <<Authorization>> section, we discussed that the Sync Gateway can enforce authorization check using the `requireUser` API. 
<5> The `channels` are used to specify the channels to pull from. Only documents belonging to the specified channels are synced. This is subject to <<Access Control>> rights enforced at the Sync Gateway. 
+
* Initialize the `Replicator` with the `ReplicatorConfiguration` 
+
[source,swift]
----
include::{examplesdir}/UserProfileDemo/model/DatabaseManager.swift[tags=replicationinit]
----
+
* We attach a callback listener to the `Replicator` to be asynchronously notified of state changes. This could be useful for instance, to inform the user of the progress of the replication. This is an optional step
+
[source,swift]
----
include::{examplesdir}/UserProfileDemo/model/DatabaseManager.swift[tags=replicationlistener]
----
+
* Start the replicator
+
[source,swift]
----
include::{examplesdir}/UserProfileDemo/model/DatabaseManager.swift[tags=replicationstart]
----

== Stopping Replication
When user logs out of the app, the replication is stopped before the database is closed. 

* Open the **DatabaseManager.swift** file and locate the `stopAllReplicationForCurrentUser()` function.
+
[source,swift]
----
include::{examplesdir}/UserProfileDemo/model/DatabaseManager.swift[tags=stopAllReplicationForCurrentUser]
----
+
NOTE:All open replicators must be stopped before database is closed. There will be an exception if you attempt to close the database without closing the active replicators.

== Query Events / Live Queries
In couchbase Lite 2.0, the app can set up _live queries_ in order to be asynchronously notified of changes to the database that affect the results of the query. This would be very useful for instance, to keep a UI View up-to-date with the results of a query.

In our app, the user profile view is kept up-to-date with a live query that fetches the user profile data that is used to populate the view. This means that, if the replicator pulls down changes to the user profile, it will be automatically reflected in the view.

* Open the **UserPresenter.swift** file and locate the `fetchRecordForCurrentUserWithLiveModeEnabled()` function. Calling this function with a value of `true` implies that the caller wishes to be notified of any changes to query results.
+
[source,swift]
----
include::{examplesdir}/UserProfileDemo/model/UserPresenter.swift[tags=fetchRecordForCurrentUserWithLiveModeEnabled]
----
+
* Build the Query using `QueryBuilder` API. If you are unfamiliar with this API, please check out this link:https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/mobile/2.0/userprofile_query.html[tutorial].
+
[source,swift]
----
include::{examplesdir}/UserProfileDemo/model/UserPresenter.swift[tags=livequerybuilder]
----
<1> We query for documents based on document Id. In our app, there should be exactly one user profile document corresponding to this Id.
+
* Attach listener callback to the query to make it _live_
+
[source,swift]
----
include::{examplesdir}/UserProfileDemo/model/UserPresenter.swift[tags=livequery]
----
+
<1> Attach a listener callback to the query. Attaching a listerner automatically makes it _live_ so any time there is a change in the user profile data in the underlying database, the callback would be invoked
<2> Create an instance of <<UserRecord>>. This will be populated with the query results.
<3> The `SelectResult.all()` method is used to query all the properties of a document. In this case, the document in the result is embedded in a dictionary where the key is the database name, which is _"userprofile"_. So we retrieve the link:http://docs.couchbase.com/mobile/2.0/couchbase-lite-swift/Classes/DictionaryObject.html[`DictionaryObject`] at key _"userprofile"_.
<4>  We use appropriate _type getters_ to retrieve values and populate the _UserRecord_ instance
+
== Exercise 1 
In this exercise, we will observe changes synced across apps
* The app should be running in two simulators side by side
* Log into both the simulators with same userId and password. Let's use the values _"demo@example.com"_ and _"password"_ for user Id and password fields respectively. 
* On one simulator, enter values in the user and address fields
* Confirm that changes show up in the app on the other simulator

image::db_locations.png[Database Locations]

== Live Queries
The Query API in Couchbase Lite 2.0 is extensive. In our app, we will be using the `QueryBuilder` API to make a simple _pattern matching_ query using the `like` Query Expression. 

=== Fetching University Document
Once the user logs in, the user is taken to the "Your Profile" screen. When the user taps on the "University" cell, a search screen is displayed where the user can enter the search criteria (name and optionally, the location) for the university. When the search criteria is entered, the local _"universities"_ Database is queried for <<The "University" Document>> documents that match the specified search criteria. 

* Open the *UniversityPresenter.swift* file and locate the `fetchUniversityRecords()` function.
+
[source,swift]
----
include::{examplesdir}/UserProfileDemo/presenter/UniversityPresenter.swift[tags=fetchUniversityRecords]
----

* We build the Query using the `QueryBuilder` API that will look for Documents that match the specified criteria.
+
[source,swift]
----
include::{examplesdir}/UserProfileDemo/presenter/UniversityPresenter.swift[tags=buildquery]
----
<1> Build a `QueryExpression` that uses the `like` operator to look for the specified _"name"_ string in the _"name"_ property. Notice couple of things here - (a) The use of *wildcard "%" operator* to denote that we are looking for the presence of the string anywhere in the _"name"_ property and (b) The use of `Function.lowercase()` to convert the search string into lowercase equivalent. Since `like` operator does _case-senstive matching_, we convert the search string and the property value to lowercase equivalents and compare the two.
<2> If the location criteria was specified in the search, then Build a `QueryExpression` that uses the `like` operator to look for the specified _"location"_ string in the _"location"_ property.
<3> The `SelectResult.all()` specifiees that we are interested in all properties in Documents that match the specified criteria
<4> The `DataSource.database(db)` specified the Data Source
<5> We include the `where` clause that is the logical ANDing of the QueryExpression in <1> and <2>


* We run the Query by calling the `execute()` method on the Query that was constructed in the previous step
+
[source,swift]
----
include::{examplesdir}/UserProfileDemo/presenter/UniversityPresenter.swift[tags=runquery]
----
<1> Create an instance of <<UniversityRecord>> type
<1> Use specific type getters to fetch property values. These <<UniversityRecord>> instance is populated with these property values.
<2> Getters also available for `array` types. This returns a Couchbase Lite `ArrayObject` type. So you would have to use `toArray()` to convert the Couchbase Lite native array equivalent.

=== Try It Out
* You should have followed the steps discussed in the "Try It Out" section under <<Loading the Prebuilt Database>>
* Tap on "University" table cell
* You should see a screen show that allows you enter the search criteria for the university
* Enter "Harv" for name . You can optionally enter "united states" for location
* Confirm that you see a list of universities that match the criteria
+
image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/couchbaselabs/userprofile-couchbase-mobile/standalone/content/modules/userprofile/assets/images/university_list.gif[University List]
+
* Select a university 
* Press "Done" button
* Confirm that the university you selected shows up in the University table cell
+
image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/couchbaselabs/userprofile-couchbase-mobile/standalone/content/modules/userprofile/assets/images/university_selection.gif[University Selection]
+
* You can optionally fill in other entries in the User Profile screen
* Tap "Done" button
* Confirm that you see an alert message "Succesfully Updated Profile". The Document will be updated this time.
* Tap "Log Off" and log out of the app
* Log back into the app with the same user email Id and password that you used earlier. In my example, I used _"demo@example.com"_ and _"password"_. So I will log in with those credentials again.
* Confirm that you see the profile screen  with the _university_ value that you set earlier.
